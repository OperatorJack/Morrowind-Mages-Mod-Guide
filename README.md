# OperatorJack's Mage's Mod Guide  
A mod list for the aspiring mage, in TES III: Morrowind. This is a curated mod list that contains mods I personally use, including mods that I have made. Some popular mods will not be on this list, because I do not think they are high quality, or they do not fit the vanilla aesthetic. This mod list does not contain aesthetic mods, such as Mage's Guild aesthetic changes, VFX updates, etc. 

## Requirements
**[MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)**  
Some mods in this mod list require the latest version of the Morrowind Script Extender, MWSE. It is bundled with MGE XE. After installing MGE XE, be sure to run mwse-update.exe in your data files folder to update MWSE to the latest version.

## Gameplay Mechanics
New gameplay mechanics will be listed here.

**[Illegal Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105) by *OperatorJack***  
Using MWSE Lua, this mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Applies to the player, NPCs, and creatures.

**[Purist Friendly Magicka Regen](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45636) by *Remiros & Greatness7***  
Adds fully functioning magicka regeneration to the game.

## Magic
New magic, magic effects, enchantments, and other magic-specific mechanics will be listed here.

**[Magicka Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111?tab=description) by *OperatorJack & RedFurryDemon***  
A lua-based framework for creating new, fully functional magic effects. Currently adds 103 new magic effects.

Adds over 100 new magic effects to the game. Unlike older spell mods such as Cortex's Scripted Spells, these effects are fully integrated into the game engine and do not use global scripts or other "hacky" methods to work. They work just like vanilla effects.  
**This framework is required for many of the mods in this mod list.**

**[Customizable MWSE Multi Mark and Harder Recall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47065) by *Virnetch***  
An overhaul of the mark and recall system using MWSE 2.1 to allow:
- Multiple mark locations, even from other mods. Teleport companions to your location. Limit number of marks by mysticism.
- Higher magicka cost and lower cast chance for long recall distances.
- Limited number of daily recalls.

## Armour
New armours for mages and magic-based characters.  

**[Mage Robes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45739) by *Melchior Dahrk***  
The concept behind the mod is to provide both an immersive experience by adding a uniform to mages guild members as well as to improve gameplay by providing a useful alternative to armor for mages; such as is offered in Skyrim. Many Mages Guild members will now wear the new robes and the player can acquire the robes through quests and purchase.

## Items, Objects, and Clothes  
New items, objects, and clothes for mages and magic-based characters.  

**[Scrolls of The Nine Barriers](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45831) by *Melchior Dahrk***  
This mod adds the missing 7th and 8th barrier scrolls, adds a quest to find the (now rare) 9th barrier scroll, adds new lore surrounding The Nine Barriers, and much more!

**[Mage Lights](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46768) by *Stripes***
