# Morrowind Mages Mod Guide
### By OperatorJack
A mod list for the aspiring mage, in TES III: Morrowind.

## Requirements
**[MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)**  
Some mods in this mod list require the latest version of the Morrowind Script Extender, MWSE. It is bundled with MGE XE. After installing MGE XE, be sure to run mwse-update.exe in your data files folder to update MWSE to the latest version.

## Gameplay Mechanics
New gameplay mechanics will be listed here.

**[Illegal Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105) by *OperatorJack***  
Using MWSE Lua, this mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Applies to the player, NPCs, and creatures.

## Magic
New magic, magic effects, enchantments, and other magic-specific mechanics will be listed here.

**[Magicka Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111?tab=description) by *OperatorJack & RedFurryDemon***  
A lua-based framework for creating new, fully functional magic effects. Currently adds 103 new magic effects.

Adds over 100 new magic effects to the game. Unlike older spell mods such as Cortex's Scripted Spells, these effects are fully integrated into the game engine and do not use global scripts or other "hacky" methods to work. They work just like vanilla effects.  
**This framework is required for many of the mods in this mod list.**
